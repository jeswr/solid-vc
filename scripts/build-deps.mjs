// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
//
// Inline dependency build for `@jeswr/fetch-rdf` — the suite's `build:packages`
// pattern. Because the suite pins `ignore-scripts=true` (supply-chain hardening),
// the git/npm dependency's own `prepare` build never runs, and the published
// tarball / git pack of `@jeswr/fetch-rdf@0.1.0` ships NO `dist/` (a known
// upstream packaging gap — its `files` is `["dist","README.md"]` but `dist/` is
// absent at pack time). So we build it ourselves, once, after install: clone the
// source, compile it with the local TypeScript, and drop the built `dist/` into
// `node_modules/@jeswr/fetch-rdf`.
//
// REPRODUCIBILITY: the clone is pinned to the EXACT git commit resolved in
// `package-lock.json` (not a moving `main`), so the built dep always matches the
// lockfile-resolved version — `npm ci` on CI and a dev `npm install` build the
// same source. Building from `main` would silently drift from the lockfile.
//
// DURABLE FIX: this whole `build:deps` hack exists ONLY because
// `@jeswr/fetch-rdf` does not publish a usable `dist/`. Once fetch-rdf ships a
// proper packaged `dist` (the upstream packaging fix), DELETE this script and the
// `build:deps` step entirely and depend on the published package directly.
//
// Idempotent: if `dist/index.js` is already present (e.g. a workspace symlink or
// a prior run) this is a no-op. Network is needed only the first time.
