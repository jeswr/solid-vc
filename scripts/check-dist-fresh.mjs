// AUTHORED-BY Claude Opus 4.8 (Fable unavailable) — re-review/upgrade candidate
/**
 * check-dist-fresh — guard against the COMMITTED `dist/` drifting from `src/`.
 *
 * `dist/` is committed (not gitignored) so the package installs directly from a
 * GitHub branch without a build step — consumers run under `ignore-scripts=true`
 * and never execute this package's `prepare`/`build`. That only stays correct if
 * the committed artifact matches the source. This script rebuilds into a scratch
 * dir (the SAME bundled build as `npm run build` — esbuild bundles `index.js`
 * with `@jeswr/fetch-rdf` inlined; tsc emits the `.d.ts`) and diffs the emitted
 * JavaScript + declarations against the version of `dist/` at git HEAD.
 *
 * Why compare against git HEAD, not the working-tree `dist/`:
 *  - `npm run build` overwrites the working-tree `dist/`. If this check read the
 *    working tree, then running it AFTER `build` would compare a fresh build
 *    against a just-overwritten fresh build — always equal, so a STALE *committed*
 *    `dist/` would never be caught. Comparing against the blobs at
 *    `HEAD:dist/<path>` makes the check independent of whether `build` ran first
 *    and of the working tree's state: it asks "does what's COMMITTED match a fresh
 *    build of the COMMITTED src?", which is the property that actually keeps the
 *    GitHub-installable artifact correct.
 *
 * It deliberately ignores the `*.map` sourcemap files: their byte content can
 * vary with absolute paths / tooling versions (the scratch outDir differs from
 * the committed build's cwd), and they are not load-bearing for a consumer
 * importing the package. Code (`.js`) and types (`.d.ts`) are what matter.
 *
 * Exit 0 = in sync; exit 1 = drift (run `npm run build` and commit `dist/`).
